# Train new model using Scout

Before training the new model you must connect to a Datasource. To learn how to do that check out:

* [Connect to MySQL](/docs/datasources/mysql)
* [Connect to PostgreSQL](/docs/datasources/mysql)
* [Connect to MariaDB](/docs/datasources/mariadb).
* [Connect to ClickHouse](/docs/datasources/clickhouse)
* [Connect to remote URL](/docs/datasources/remote)
* [Upload local dataset](/docs/datasources/local)
* [Connect to Snowflake](/docs/datasources/snowflake)

### Basic mode

Training the new model from MindsDB Scout is quite easy:

1. From the left navigation menu open `Predictors` dashboard.
2. Click on the `TRAIN NEW` button.
3. In the `New Predictor` modal:
    1. Select the `From` datasource option.
    2. Add the name of the model.
    3. Check the column name (feature) that you want to predict.
    4. Press `TRAIN`.

### Advanced mode

In the `Advanced mode`, you can find a few additional options to train the Machine Learning model as use GPU for training, exclude columns from training or change the sample margin of error. To do that, inside the `New Predictor` modal:

1. Select the `From` datasource option.
2. Add the name of the model.
3. Check the column name (feature) that you want to predict.
4. Press the `ADVANCED MODE` button and:
    1. Check the `USE GPU` checkbox.
    2. Check the columns that you want to exclude from model training.
    3. Add the `sample margin of error` value.
5. Press `TRAIN`.

#### Timeseries

To build the timeseries model, you need to select `Yes, it is` timeseries checkbox inside the `Advanced Mode` section:

1. Select the `From` datasource option.
2. Add the name of the model.
3. Check the column name (feature) that you want to predict.
4. Press the `ADVANCED MODE` button and:
    1. Check the `Yes, it is.` checkbox.
    2. Select the `Order by:` value, the column based on which the data should be ordered.
    3. Select the `Group by:` value, the column based on which to group multiple entities in timeseries data.
    4. Add the `Look Back Window:` value, the number of rows to `look back` into when making a prediction.
5. Press `TRAIN`.

!!! Success "That's all :tada: :trophy:  :computer:"
    You have successfully trained a new Machine Learning model. The next step is to evaluate the [model quality](/docs/model/quality).
