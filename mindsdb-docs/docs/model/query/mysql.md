# Query the model from MySQL database

This section assumes that you have trained new model using [mysql](/docs/model/mysql/) or [MindsDB Scout](/docs/model/train/). To query the model, you will neeed to `SELECT` from the model table as:

```sql
SELECT
   <target_variable> AS predicted,
   <target_variable_confidence> AS confidence,
   <target_variable_explain> AS info 
FROM
   mindsdb.<model_name>
WHERE 
   when_data=<JSON features values>
```
!!! question "Query the model from other databases"
    Note that even if you have trained the model from the MySQL database, you will be able to
    query it from other databases too.

## Query example

The following example shows you how to query the model from mysql-client. The table used for training the model is the same as [Us consumption](https://github.com/robjhyndman/fpp2-package/blob/15916e4fe827d1b3dcf82785a4ace80107af5ddd/data-raw/usconsumption.csv) dataset. MindsDB will predict the `consumption` based on the values added in `when_data`.

```sql
SELECT
   consumption AS predicted,
   consumption_confidence AS confidence,
   consumption_explain AS info 
FROM
   mindsdb.us_consumption 
WHERE 
   when_data='{"income": 1.182497938, "production": 5.854555956,"savings": 3.183292657, "unemployment": 0.1, "t":"2020-01-02"}';
```
You should get a similar response from MindsDB as:

| consumption  | confidence | info   |
|----------------|------------|------|
| 1.0 | 0.93 | Check JSON bellow  |

```json
info: {
    "predicted_value": "1.0",
    "confidence": 0.93,
    "prediction_quality": "very confident",
    "important_missing_information": []
}
```
